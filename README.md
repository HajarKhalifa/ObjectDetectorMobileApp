# Object Detector MobileApp
Object Detector  Mobile App using Flutter &amp; yolov5s.torchscript
# How It Works
1. Initialize the mobile app and set up the user interface.
2. Load the pre-trained object detection model (YOLOv5) using TorchScript.
3. Start the camera module to capture images or video frames.
4. Repeat the following steps: 

a. Capture an image or video frame using the camera module.

b. Pass the captured image or frame to the object detection module.

c. Invoke the object detection API to perform object detection.

d. Receive the detected object results.

e. Process the results and display them on the user interface.

5.End the object detection process and close the camera module.
